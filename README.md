# JacobiNet
JacobiNet is a Python library built on Keras that constructs the backward pass as a Keras model using the chain rule to compute Jacobians. It provides a clear, modular framework for understanding and analyzing gradient propagation, making it a valuable tool for researchers and educators in deep learning.

# JacobiNet
***JacobiNet*** is a Python library built on Keras that constructs the backward pass as a Keras model using the chain rule to compute Jacobians. It provides a clear, modular framework for understanding and analyzing gradient propagation, making it a valuable tool for researchers and educators in deep learning.
It enables researchers and developers to efficiently analyze, manipulate, and utilize the Jacobian structure of neural models in downstream tasks.

**Features**
-Neural Jacobian Encoding: Parse a neural network and construct a neural network that represents its Jacobian.
-Seamless Integration with Keras: Built on Keras, ensuring compatibility with TensorFlow and Keras models.
-Customizable Layers: Allows users to specify which layers to include when computing the Jacobian.
-Efficient Computation: Optimized for performance, leveraging GPU acceleration for large-scale models.
-Extensibility: Easy to integrate with existing workflows and extend to custom use cases.
